Project Overview:

The Online Delivery Application is a user-friendly platform for browsing products, placing orders, and tracking deliveries. It includes features like user authentication, secure payments, and real-time order updates. Designed for scalability, it caters to customers, vendors, and admins, streamlining operations while ensuring efficiency and reliability.

I created a React project for frontend with the name as "online-delivery-frontend".

If you want to run the code the commands are 

cd online-delivery-frontend
npm start

If you Register with the Email ID, password with the role the pop message will shown like 
"Registration Successful! You are registered as a customer/ vendor/ delivery personnel/ Admin."

After, the user will directly go to the Login page. then the user can see the navbar like home, resturants, dashboard, orders, reviews etc. 

In resturants you can see the different item products in the resturant the user can add the quantity and search for the item in the navbar also. And, the user can also see the price and the description of the item of the resturant. 


In Orders page the user can order the item of the product with the and they can see the status of the order.
